# Rooted

**One word a day. Its full story. Told visually.**

---

Rooted is a daily etymology app. Every day it picks one word and shows you where it came from -- not as a dictionary entry, but as a visual story you scroll through.

Words have histories. "Muscle" comes from the Latin word for "little mouse" because that is what a flexing bicep looked like to ancient Romans. "Coffee" traces a route from Ethiopian highlands through Yemeni monasteries to Venetian trade ports. "Sabotage" comes from French workers throwing wooden shoes (sabots) into machines. These are not trivia. These are the actual origins baked into the words you already use.

## How it works

You open the app. There is one word. You scroll.

The story unfolds through one of four visualization types, chosen based on what fits the word best:

- **Map** -- for words tied to geography: trade routes, migration, conquest. An animated path traces the word's physical journey across continents.
- **Tree** -- for words where meaning branched over time. A root node expands into language families and modern derivatives. "Captain," "cape," and "cabbage" all grow from the Latin word for "head."
- **Timeline** -- for words with clear historical turning points. Scroll through eras and see how context reshaped meaning.
- **Grid** -- for words with interesting cross-linguistic patterns. See how "mother" sounds nearly the same in Sanskrit, Latin, Greek, Persian, and Old English.

After the visualization, there is a short fact and a share button. That is the whole experience. No sidebar. No search bar. No tabs. One word, one scroll, one story.

## Why this exists

Dictionary apps treat words as data. Rooted treats them as stories. The gap between reading a definition and understanding where a word actually came from is the entire point of this project.
